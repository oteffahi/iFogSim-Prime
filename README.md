# iFogSim-Prime
iFogSim-Prime is a fork of the original iFogSim toolkit. The main focus of this version is to improve the accessibility to new users by providing templates, better in-depth examples, and overall a higher-level approach to making topologies, running simulations and harvesting results.<br>
# Differences with current iFogSim
This version fixes multiple major bugs for tuple scheduling, VM instanciation and ressource consumption.<br>
It also offers a correct implementation of network usage for each device individually.<br>
Finally, everything related to GUI classes, including themselves, have been deleted because they tend to draw the attention of new users despite being completely worthless for simulations.<br><br>
Other features will be added in the near future, including multi-parent Fog nodes, and a higher-level approach to topology classes.
